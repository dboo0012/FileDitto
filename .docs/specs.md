### Comprehensive Developer Specification for Desktop Web App Using FFMPEG Direct CLI Calls

#### **1. Project Overview**

**Objective:** Develop a desktop web application that leverages ffmpeg directly through function wrappers to convert files. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for file selection, format selection, and batch processing, while handling metadata management and error scenarios effectively.

**Key Features:**

- **File Upload:** Support drag-and-drop functionality for uploading files.
- **Format Selection:** Allow users to choose target formats for conversion.
- **Batch Processing:** Enable conversion of multiple files in a single operation.
- **Metadata Management:** Extract and manage metadata for each file.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages and recovery options.
- **Security:** Ensure data encryption and secure conversion settings.

#### **2. Architecture**

**Frontend:**

- **Technologies:** React.js for the user interface (UI) framework.
- **Technique:** Electron integration for cross-platform desktop application development.
- **Goals:** Provide a clean, intuitive interface for file selection, format selection, and batch processing.

**Backend:**

- **Technologies:** Node.js for executing ffmpeg commands, PostgreSQL for database integration.
- **Goals:** Handle file conversion logic, manage user sessions, and store metadata and conversion history.

**Database:**

- **Technology:** PostgreSQL for storing user sessions, file metadata, and conversion history.
- **Goals:** Ensure data integrity, provide analytics, and support batch processing.

#### **3. User Requirements**

**Functionalities:**

1. **File Upload:**

   - Users can upload files using drag-and-drop functionality or file selection dialogues.
   - Support multiple file types (e.g., image, video, document formats).

2. **Format Selection:**

   - Users can select target formats for conversion (e.g., image resizing, video encoding).
   - Provide recommendations based on input file type.

3. **Batch Processing:**

   - Enable conversion of multiple files in a single operation.
   - Provide a preview of selected files and conversion status.

4. **Metadata Management:**

   - Extract metadata (e.g., image dimensions, video bitrate) from input files.
   - Users can add or remove metadata tags.

5. **Error Handling:**

   - Users receive clear error messages for failed conversions.
   - Provide options to retry failed conversions or discard files.

6. **Security:**
   - Encrypt input and output files.
   - Secure conversion settings and file paths.

#### **4. Technical Requirements**

**Frontend:**

- **User Interface:** Implement a modern, user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Component Framework:** Use React components for different parts of the interface (e.g., file upload, format selection).
- **State Management:** Use React state hooks (useState, useStateList) for managing user interactions and file processing state.

**Backend:**

- **FFmpeg Integration:** Directly call ffmpeg CLI commands using function wrappers.
- **File Processing:** Handle file uploads, executions, and results.
- **Database Integration:** Store user sessions, file metadata, and conversion history in PostgreSQL.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js for building the UI.
- **Electron:** Used to create a desktop application with React components.
- **Node.js:** Execute ffmpeg commands for file conversions.
- **PostgreSQL:** For database management and user sessions.

#### **5. Data Requirements**

- **File Handling:** Support multiple file types, including images, videos, and documents.
- **Metadata Extraction:** Extract and manage metadata for each file.
- **File Encryption:** Encrypt both input and output files.
- **Metadata Management:** Users can add or remove metadata tags.

#### **6. Error Handling**

- **Command Execution:** Use function wrappers to execute ffmpeg commands.
- **Error Detection:** Detect and handle errors during file conversion.
- **User Feedback:** Provide clear error messages and instructions for failed conversions.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that important file information is saved and accessible for recovery.

#### **7. Testing Plan**

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and functions to ensure they work as expected.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the end-to-end functionality of the application.
- **Load Testing:** Test the application's performance with multiple files being processed simultaneously.

#### **8. Project Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1:** Core Functionality

   - Implement basic file upload, format selection, and batch processing.
   - Develop and test the ffmpeg CLI wrapper functions.
   - Set up the user interface with drag-and-drop functionality and conversion status indicators.

2. **Phase 2:** Advanced Features

   - Implement metadata management and extraction.
   - Add user preferences and history tracking.
   - Develop file encryption and decryption features.

3. **Phase 3:** Security and Usability Enhancements
   - Add multi-factor authentication.
   - Provide advanced error recovery options.
   - Implement additional UI features for metadata management.

#### **9. Conclusion**

This specification outlines the requirements and architecture for a desktop web app that leverages ffmpeg directly through function wrappers. By following this guide, a developer can implement a robust, user-friendly application for file conversion with strong error handling and data management capabilities. The use of Electron and PostgreSQL ensures scalability and flexibility, while direct ffmpeg integration provides access to powerful video and audio conversion tools.
